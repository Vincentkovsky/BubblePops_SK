BubblePops is a game running on iOS and iPadOS, which was developed by integratedly use SpriteKit and UIkit.

Althogh someone on stackoverflow said it's difficult to import UIkit elements into the SKscene offered by SpriteKit due to their poor compatibility,
but I truly overcame that by creating subview. 

There are some more optimizations to do on this game. 
Such as, better bubble images, better sound effects and smooth the abrupt transition caused by the subview.
I will keep working on it for the following weeks.
